## Who Am I?
With what should I get started?    
Mhh... I think I'll start with my name,    
Well, my name is **shoaiyb sysa**,     
I'm 17 years old, Yes 17 years old.     
I'm the youngest in our family,      
I mostly like to play football but sometimes I play tv games,       
I started to blog since when I was 13, At that time I've being so angry by everything I know it's possible but I can't archive it.      
After being sucked in the blogging world, At 15 I move to YouTube, And finally I found out my self stuck in the web development world.     


## What Am I Doing Now?
As I said I'm a developer now, I'm always playing with some code editors,    
And sometimes searching something very important as a developer.   


## What I've Archived?
### sysa.css

Actually I've never done something unique, something very important for others in my life as a blogger, youtuber and a developer,   
But I'm always looking for what newbies are struggling with and find out the solutions.
