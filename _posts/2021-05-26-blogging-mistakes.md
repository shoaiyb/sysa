## Focusing on quantity over quality
That is something that quite a lot of bloggers do.       
Instead of focusing on providing quality content, they focus on quantity.        
There are two reasons for making this huge blogging mistake.        
The first has to do with people wanting their blogs to look fresh, always providing new stuff to readers.        
The second reason has to do with SEO (Search Engine Optimization).        
Bloggers tend to focus more on improving their ranks in search engines, without caring too much about the quality of their content.       
That is exactly why the “quantity over quality” approach is a mistake.        
You may improve your SEO ranking that way, but only for a short time, as your content will be underperforming.       
An excellent blog post requires time for adequate research, not to mention for writing and editing.       
Only when you make sure to provide quality blog content, will you be able actually to yield positive results.      

## Failing to work on improving your grammar
If you keep providing content filled with grammar mistakes, people will not think of you as a professional.       
You will paint the picture of a lazy blogger who doesn’t want to make an effort to appeal to and connect with the readers.       
Grammar mistakes will kill your credibility.     
Thus, if you are having trouble constructing correct sentences, make sure that you work on improving your grammar.       
You can use tools like Grammarly that would help you improve your writing.

## Failing to select and focus on the right audience
If you try and write content for everybody, your blog will end up being too generic.      
That will not bring positive results.       
You need to understand who your target audience is so that you can focus on tailoring your content to them.       
That is exactly how you will create a community of people who want to listen to what you have to say.       
Focusing on a specific demographic will enable you to provide valuable content, relevant, and useful to an audience.

## Repeating others’ opinions
One of the most common blogging mistakes is taking other people’s views and including them in your content as your own.       
That isn’t plagiarism, but it borders on it.       
If you want others to take you seriously, you cannot regurgitate others’ opinions – you need to have your own.       
If you repackage existing information, why should people read your blog in the first place? They can find what they need someplace else.       
If you share someone’s opinion, make a twist and show what you think about the matter in question.       
You can even cite others in your blog posts, which will help you forge new connections.        
Nonetheless, the key is to tackle every topic from your perspective.       
That will make you unique and credible, and help you establish yourself as an expert in your niche.

## Spending too little time sharing your content on social media
No matter the type of your blog, you run it to promote something, be it your business, your art, or anything else that made you want to create one in the first place.        
To promote your blog and its content, you need to attract customers or followers.       
What better way of doing that than to establish your presence on social media using social media tools? You need to share your content on the social media networks that preferred by the target audience.      
That way you can extend your reach and achieve your goals.       
You need to engage them and communicate with them so that you can build and grow your list of subscribers.        
You need to be active on social media, but remember not to spam your followers.       
That will only annoy them and push them away.

## Focusing too much on self-promotion and sales pitches
If you pitch every single blog posts and you indulge in too much self-promotion, you will have a tough time selling anything.       
People will see you as another marketer who doesn’t care about them.      
But instead, sees them only as sales opportunities.        
Your blog should be so much more than a place for sales pitches.       
It should provide insights, solutions, and useful advice that will improve the lives of your audience.      
When you provide all that and give them value, you will instill trust, and sooner or later they will want to buy from you.       
Thus, create content that will make a difference, and you can be sure that real sales opportunities will arise.

## Taking too long to get your content out
Procrastination is the killer of motivation and success.     
Time is of the essence.       
The sooner you publish your content, the sooner you can reap the rewards and generate leads.       
One of the common blogging mistakes is trying to make your every blog post perfect.       
You should never obsess over it because there will always be something more to do to improve your content.       
The longer you take to get your content out, the more things you will want to change.      
Sometimes, it’s better to hit “publish” and focus on your other tasks and new blog posts.      
After all, you can always update your posts anytime you want.

## Not taking the time to guest post on other blogs
Your blog shouldn’t be all alone in the vast sea of blogs.       
Guest blogging will get you to a whole new world of possibilities.     
You can build a network of professional bloggers who can help you make a real difference.     
Thus, take the time to connect with other bloggers in your niche.      
Not only will you serve them to promote their content, but you will also enjoy free publicity from them, which can go a long way.       
If you connect with influential bloggers, it will be a matter of time when you become one of the big guns.

## Failing to interact with the community
You cannot ignore your readers and expect positive results.     
If you keep neglecting them, they will take their trust and loyalty someplace else.       
If you want to connect with the community you have created, you need to interact with your audience.       
Answer their questions, respond to their comments, and take their feedback into account.        
If the audience suggests that you should change something, you should consider it.       
After all, it’s reader needs that you have to please.     
You never know – seeing things from their perspective may open the door to significant opportunities for improvement.      
Interacting with your community will help you forge strong relationships, and they will feel valued.

## Failing to set up a coherent content schedule
In the world of blogging, consistency is key.      
If you don’t update your content on a regular basis, you can lose a lot of traffic and quality leads.       
It can affect your SEO ranking, and your readers may even completely lose interest in your blog.       
Not only will, setting up a consistent schedule help you develop a habit, but your readers will also know when to expect new content.       
It will support you in establishing trust and credibility, as you will show that you are a professional who cares about them.
