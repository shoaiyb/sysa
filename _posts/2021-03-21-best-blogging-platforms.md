Starting a blog and wondering what are the best blog sites?        
It can be a tricky choice since it’s a big decision and there are a lot of unique options out there.        
In this post, I’ve made it easy for you to pick what works best for you with a list of the best blogging platforms for beginners.    


## How to Choose the Best Blogging Platform
Before diving into my list of the best blog sites, it’s important to make sure you know what you’re looking for in a blogging platform.     
Ask yourself these 3 questions about blogging platforms:       

- Is it easy to set up?     
If you’re new to blogging or even just thinking about starting a blog, you may not be very technical yet (or may not ever be).       
So, you want to look for a blogging platform that’s super user-friendly.       

- Does it have the option for me to earn money with my website?       
Even if it’s not something you want to do right now, you’ll want a platform that lets you make money off your site in case you want to do that in the future.        

- Is it flexible so it can grow with my site?        
As your blog grows, you’ll want to change the look of your site and add new advanced features to support your growing audience.        


So now that you have a better idea about exactly how to choose the best blogging platform to build your blog,        
let’s take a look at my picks for the best blogging platforms for beginners.         


## Which Is the Best Blogging Platform for Beginners?
Here are the best blogging platforms for beginners:       

### WordPress.org

This is truly and universally the best free blogging platform.         
Above all, the very best choice (and the most popular) for all bloggers is WordPress.org. It’s incredibly customizable and flexible, which explains why it powers over 30% of all the websites on the internet.      
It’s the best of the free blog sites, as well as paid ones.       

Many blogging newbies confuse WordPress.org with WordPress.com. Check out my post on [WordPress.org vs WordPress.com](/difference-between-wordpress.org-and-wordpress.com/) for a great comparison on WordPress blogging.    

This is the best choice if you want full control over the future of your blog and nearly limitless customization options.        
WordPress.org is a self-hosted WordPress option, meaning you’ll need a WordPress hosting provider.        
<!--Bluehost is by far the best WordPress hosting to get started with WordPress.org.-->

**Pros**:      
- Full and complete control over your blog:        
Using this robust Content Management System lets you create any kind of site from a WordPress blog to an eCommerce store.       

- Easy optimization for search:       
Just install the All in One SEO plugin to add tons of extra SEO features to WordPress.         

- Easily customize the look of your website:         
You can use drag and drop website builder themes like Divi, Astra, or OceanWP to easily make your WordPress site look exactly the way you want it, and create a custom login form to improve your branding.          

- Easily Integrate Analytics:       
You can use a plugin to set up Google Analytics on WordPress.       

- Amazing options for functionality:        
Your WordPress website can be enhanced in a ton of different ways by using plugins.       

**Cons**:       
- Doesn’t handle security:       
You’ll need to manage your own backups and security (with a security plugin like Sucuri)         

- Not always beginner-friendly:
Can have a slight learning curve for non-technical people who don’t use helpful tutorial sites like [{{ site.title }}](/).
