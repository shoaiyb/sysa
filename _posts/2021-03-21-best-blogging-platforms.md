## How to Choose the Best Blogging Platform
Before diving into my list of the best blog sites, it’s important to make sure you know what you’re looking for in a blogging platform.     
Ask yourself these 3 questions about blogging platforms:       

- Is it easy to set up?     
If you’re new to blogging or even just thinking about starting a blog, you may not be very technical yet (or may not ever be).       
So, you want to look for a blogging platform that’s super user-friendly.       

- Does it have the option for me to earn money with my website?       
Even if it’s not something you want to do right now, you’ll want a platform that lets you make money off your site in case you want to do that in the future.        

- Is it flexible so it can grow with my site?        
As your blog grows, you’ll want to change the look of your site and add new advanced features to support your growing audience.        


So now that you have a better idea about exactly how to choose the best blogging platform to build your blog,        
let’s take a look at my picks for the best blogging platforms for beginners.         


## Which Is the Best Blogging Platform for Beginners?
Here are the best blogging platforms for beginners:       

### WordPress.org

![wordpress](/assets/images/wordpress.png)         

This is truly and universally the best free blogging platform.         
Above all, the very best choice (and the most popular) for all bloggers is WordPress.org. It’s incredibly customizable and flexible, which explains why it powers over 30% of all the websites on the internet.      
It’s the best of the free blog sites, as well as paid ones.       

Many blogging newbies confuse WordPress.org with WordPress.com. Check out my post on [WordPress.org vs WordPress.com](/difference-between-wordpress.org-and-wordpress.com/) for a great comparison on WordPress blogging.    

This is the best choice if you want full control over the future of your blog and nearly limitless customization options.        
WordPress.org is a self-hosted WordPress option, meaning you’ll need a WordPress hosting provider.        
<!--Bluehost is by far the best WordPress hosting to get started with WordPress.org.-->

**Cost**:      
Free.         
You’ll need to pay to have a custom domain name for around $10 per year + hosting around $5 per month.       

**Pros**:      
- Full and complete control over your blog:        
Using this robust Content Management System lets you create any kind of site from a WordPress blog to an eCommerce store.     

- Easy optimization for search:       
Just install the All in One SEO plugin to add tons of extra SEO features to WordPress.         

- Easily customize the look of your website:         
You can use drag and drop website builder themes like Divi, Astra, or OceanWP to easily make your WordPress site look exactly the way you want it, and create a custom login form to improve your branding.          

- Easily Integrate Analytics:       
You can use a plugin to set up Google Analytics on WordPress.       

- Amazing options for functionality:        
Your WordPress website can be enhanced in a ton of different ways by using plugins.       

**Cons**:       
- Doesn’t handle security:       
You’ll need to manage your own backups and security (with a security plugin like Sucuri)         

- Not always beginner-friendly:
Can have a slight learning curve for non-technical people who don’t use helpful tutorial sites like [{{ site.title }}](/).        


### Blogger

Blogger is one of the oldest blog platforms around and requires a Google account to get started, but may have some major deal-breakers for some looking to grow their site.         

**Cost**:      
Free.       

**Pros**:       
- Simple to start:        
Easily set up and create a blog without paying for anything.         

- Backed by Google:         
The technology giant owns the platform so it’s secure and reliable.          

**Cons**:       
- Design:          
The options for customization and design are extremely limited.         

- Limited features:         
You can’t really grow your blog with the limited basic blogging tools that are provided.         

- Dated:

### Tumblr

Tumblr is one of the most popular of all the microblogging platforms, and it’s also one of the easiest-to-use (but extremely limited) blogging sites in the world.        

**Cost**:       
Free.

You can’t adjust the formatting of your site, similar to WordPress.com.         

- Export issues:         
It’s incredibly hard to export your website to another platform if you choose to do so.           

- Limited features:         
Very few options to add functions to your blog


### Ghost

![ghost](/assets/images/ghost.png)         

Ghost is a minimalist and open-source blogging platform for website building that’s easy to use but lacks the ability to use many 3rd-party plugins.           

**Cost**:        
Self-hosting requires a custom domain around $10 per year + web hosting for around $7 per month.        

The hosted version starts at $29 per month for 2 users and up to 100,000 page views.         

**Pros**:

If you opt for the hosted version, setup is instant.           

- Built-in SEO:          
The platform comes with SEO tools to help you rank high in search engine results.           

**Cons**:       
- Limited customization: 
You can’t use most paid and free themes or plugins.         

- Branded domain: 
Unless you buy a custom domain from a 3rd-party domain registrar, your personal blog will be a Ghost subdomain ending with ghost.io.          


### Medium
