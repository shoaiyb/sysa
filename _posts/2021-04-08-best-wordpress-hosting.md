Are you launching a new site and looking for the best WordPress hosting company?       

There are 100’s of them out there, and choosing the right one for your site can [improve your SEO](/increase-wordpress-seo/) and boost your sales.       
So in this guide, we’ll discuss how to choose the best WordPress hosting service.       

## What Is WordPress Hosting?
Web hosting is where your website lives on the internet.       
So if it helps, think of WordPress hosting as a house where your website’s files, images, and content are stored.

## Do You Need a Hosting Site for WordPress?
If you want to make a website using WordPress.org, then yes, you need a hosting site.        

But if you’re using WordPress.com, you can obtain a free domain and site without signing up for hosting.        

So still asking yourself is managed WordPress hosting worth it?        

Well, if you want to have control over your website and be able to monetize it, then yes, you do need a hosting site for WordPress.         
WordPress.org allows you to add WordPress plugins to add features and customize your website as much as you want.        

WordPress.com isn’t the right service for most people, so check out my post on [WordPress.org vs WordPress.com](/difference-between-wordpress.org-and-wordpress.com/) to learn more about why you’ll probably need a hosting site for WordPress.        

Reading this because you asked which hosting service is best?         
I’ll fill you in with all the details next, but first, I’ll show you exactly how to choose the best WordPress hosting providers in 2020.        

## How to Choose the Best WordPress Hosting?
The best way to choose your website hosting service is to pay attention to these 4 important factors:        

- Speed — The server load speed should be under 300 ms         
- Uptime — A reliable hosting service will have at least 99% availability        
- Customer Service — For help with WordPress related questions         
- Your Needs — The hosting service should work with your business size and type

## How to Figure out Your Hosting Needs?
So to figure out which WordPress hosting plan will fit your needs, you’ll need to know the different kinds.        
Here are the top 5 web hosting options:        

**Shared WordPress Hosting**:         
The most popular type of entry-level WordPress hosting used by beginners offers hosting via a large shared server.       
Best for small businesses and blogging.       

**Managed WordPress Hosting**:        
Premium hosting for WordPress specifically that offers bells and whistles that keep you worry-free.        
Best for established sites or bloggers who aren’t tech-savvy and can justify the expense.        

**WordPress VPS Hosting**:         
A Virtual Private Server (VPS) can combine the privacy and control of managed hosting while still using a shared server.    
Best for medium businesses and high-traffic blogs.        

**WordPress Dedicated Server Hosting**:        
A physical server you’ll lease from the provider for full control.        
Best for extremely high-traffic sites and blogs employing a system admin.        

**Free WordPress Hosting**:        
There’s free web hosting out there, but most have some sort of catch like requiring you to put their ads on your site.       
I suggest avoiding free WordPress hosting.         

Unless you’re running an extremely high-traffic site, I recommend my readers start out with shared WordPress hosting or managed WordPress hosting.       

For even more details, check out our article about shared vs managed WordPress hosting.        

So when choosing the best WordPress web hosting, keep in mind that a good WordPress hosting company prioritizes making your site fast so you can improve user experience, rank higher in search engines.         

And a bad WordPress hosting company can lose you visitors because of slow load times and unreliable service.

### How Did Your Speed and Performance Tests Work?
I used independent 3rd-party tools like Bitcatcha, Pingdom, and Load Impact to test the performance and reliability of each of these companies, so the data above can help you make a reliable decision.        

1. **Performance**       

![performance](https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/wordpress-web-hosting-load-times.jpg)          

I used Load Impact to analyze the performance of the web hosting server.       
And we gradually built up to 100 visitors at once because we wanted to see how the servers would handle increased requests from multiple connections at the same time.         

2. **Speed**        

![speed](https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/installing-wordpress-web-hosting-companies.jpg)        

We used Pingdom, an industry-leading website speed test service, to check speed across the hosting companies.       

3. **Server Response Time**        

![srt](https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/wordpress-hosting-plan-load-times.jpg)         

Bitcatcha helped me determine server response times across from geographical locations including the US, London, Singapore, Sao Paulo, India, Sydney, and Japan.      

So now you know exactly how we got the scores for the companies on this list.
