## Conclusion
It’s easy to get lost in details when you are not very familiar with something.          
Same goes here, If you’re still undecided which platform is the best option for your next website, let’s make things even simpler.       

So, is it WordPress.org or WordPress.com?         

- WordPress.org:         
Is for website owners who want to be independent.          
That means that you build everything on your own from the ground up.           
Most importantly, you’re free to install any tools you like and control the overall website functionality.           
This is the best choice if you want to be completely on your own.             

- WordPress.com:         
Is good for you if you don’t want to get your hands dirty with hosting, third-party tools, and custom website functionality.    
You just sign up and get an online space of your own instantly.          
The downside is that you won’t be able to customize it much unless you go with an expensive plan.           

> If you want full control over your site and the best possible options, go with WordPress.org.         
> If the setup part is what scares you, I recommend <a href="/go/bluehost" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bluehost</a>, a popular host that will install WordPress for you during the checkout. You sign up for a monthly $2.95 and your WordPress site will be ready to use in just a few minutes. I'm always vouching for Bluehost because it’s cheap and basically does all the ugly work for you. Plus, you get a domain name for free.
