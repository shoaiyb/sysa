## Divi

![divi](/assets/images/divi.webp)        

Divi is the flagship WordPress theme from the Elegant Themes team that can help you create any type of website with WordPress. As it comes with the Extra theme as well as a few useful plugins for $89, it’s a great value option.

One of the best features of this popular premium WordPress theme is the integrated Divi Builder. This drag-and-drop tool makes it easy to create and design custom layouts for the pages of your WordPress website, including the homepage. Through the Divi Builder user interface, you can construct custom page layouts that are comprised of multiple rows and columns. Your layouts can then be populated with a range of modules.

The Divi Builder modules that can be dropped into your custom layouts include basic options, such as a range of text and image layouts, buttons, galleries, and block quotes. However, the Divi Builder modules can also add more advanced features to your website, which you’d otherwise have to install additional plugins to gain access to. This includes slideshows, pricing tables, testimonials, email optin forms, animated counters, and much more.

While the Divi WordPress theme and its builder tool do make creating your own custom designs from scratch straightforward, the growing selection of pre-built page templates provides a great foundation for your own layouts. These templates cover a wide range of scenarios, including multiple homepage layouts, plus all the essential pages any good website will need. Divi also includes full ecommerce support, making it a great choice for online shops.

That’s not all Divi has to offer, though. A recent update saw a split testing tool added to the theme. Divi Leads allows you to carry out split testing to optimize the different elements of your website, helping to ensure your site delivers the best results possible. Divi is becoming increasingly portable too, making it a great choice for web designers who want to be able to quickly export and import their settings into a new project. This theme is positively brimming with features and possibilities, and you can get the full lowdown in our hands-on Divi review.

Divi has been available for a few years now and has been regularly updated and improved since its release. As new features are added and improvements made, Divi keeps getting better and better. This – and its great value price tag – has helped make it a popular choice, which for many, is the best WordPress theme you can buy.

## Kalium

![kalium](/assets/images/kalium.webp)        

Kalium has lots of premium demo website content that’s easy to customize.

It is described as a creative theme for professionals, and this is reflected in the library of website demos that you get access to. Among the demos are options for agencies, photographers, architects, lawyers, bloggers, freelancers, and many other types of service providers.  The demos include all the content a typical website will need and not just the homepage template, as is sometimes the case with other themes.

Importing the demo content into your WordPress dashboard is an easy and straightforward process. You can choose which content to add to your site, such as the pages, posts, settings, and widgets, to name just a few. This gives you lots of control over how the foundation of your new website will look.

Thanks to a recent update, Kalium is even more flexible than before. While in the past you could easily customize the post and page content of your website, you can now use the integrated functionality of Kalium to edit the header area of your website. Due to this, it is possible to control what content is displayed there and how it is presented. The header editing work takes place through a modern drag-and-drop interface, so whether you’re experienced with this type of activity or not, you should be able to give your entire website a unique look.

The new and improved version of Kalium has also been tweaked to improve load times. One potential problem with multipurpose themes like this is that they can sometimes load slowly. To overcome this, the developers of Kalium have reduced the size of the website files and used conditional file loading to help your site load as quickly as possible.

If you want your professional website to have a creative look, Kalium is a theme to add to your shortlist.
