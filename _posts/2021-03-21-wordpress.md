Are you looking for a free WordPress blog theme for your website?        
There are thousands of free blog themes for WordPress, making it hard for beginners to choose between all the different options.     
The best WordPress themes can be tough to find.       
Your free theme needs to be reliable and easily customizable.       
In this article, I've hand-picked some of the best free and responsive WordPress blog themes that you can use on your site.       

## Getting Started with WordPress
First, you need to make sure that you are using the [best blogging platform](/best-blogging-platform/).        
Self-hosted WordPress.org is the perfect platform to start your blog because it gives you lots of freedom, flexibility, and control. I have a useful guide on the [difference between WordPress.org and WordPress.com](/difference-between-wordpress.com-and-wordpress.org/).     

WordPress.org is open source. It comes with support for thousands of free templates (called themes) and extensions (called plugins) that help you grow your blog faster.         
Take a look at my article on [why you should use WordPress](/why-wordpress/) to learn more.         

You can use my step by step beginner’s guide on [how to start a WordPress blog](/start-wordpress/) for full instructions on getting started.        

Once you are up and running, it’s time to pick a theme for your website.         
There are lots of excellent premium themes out there.         
However, there are also some great free themes that will help you minimize the cost of building a WordPress website.         

Follow the instructions in my [how to install a WordPress theme](/install-wordpress-theme/) guide to set it up properly.
