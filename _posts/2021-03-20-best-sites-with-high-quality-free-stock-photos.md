Pexels provides high quality and completely free stock photos licensed under the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license.      
All photos are nicely tagged, searchable and also easy to discover through their discover pages.        

## [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com)

Unsplash offers a large collection of free high-resolution photos and has become one of the best sources for stock images.    
The Unsplash team combs through new submissions and features the very best photos on their homepage.      
All photos are released for free under the Unsplash license.       

## [Burst](https://burst.shopify.com) (by shopify)

Burst is a free stock photo platform for entrepreneurs by Shopify.     
The images are both free and royalty-free. (Burst has a cool section of business ideas, with tips and high-resolution images for getting your business started.)

## [Canva](https://www.canva.com/photos/free/)

Canva is an online graphic design tool that also offers free stock photos.      
One advantage of using Canva is that you can quickly turn an image into a custom graphic to use on social media or your blog.

## [Crello](https://crello.com/)

Similar to Canva, Crello is a free graphic design tool by Depositphotos, which has many free images for you to use.      

## [Free Images](https://www.freeimages.com/)
![freeimages](/assets/images/freeimages.webp)     
Free Images provides over 300,000 free stock images under its own <a href="https://www.freeimages.com/license" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">license</a>.       
The license allows a very broad range of uses, though it does list several restricted use cases (which are quite common for most free images sites).    

## [Kaboompics](https://kaboompics.com)
![kaboompics](/assets/images/kaboompics.webp)      
Kaboompics uses its own <a href="https://kaboompics.com/page/license-and-faq" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">license</a>, which is similar to Creative Commons Zero except that you cannot redistribute its photos.     
There are two things that I love about Kaboompics: one, it allows me to search by color, and two, it provides a complementary palette of colors in the photo.     

## [Stocksnap](https://stocksnap.io)
![stocksnap](/assets/images/stocksnap.webp)      
Stocksnap uses the Creative Commons CC0 license so its photos are free to download, edit, and use for both commercial and non-commercial projects.
